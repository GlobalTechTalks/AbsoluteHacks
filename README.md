# AbsoluteHack
AbsoluteHack is a global hackathon uniting thousands of ignited minds. It is initiated by TechTalks for organizing hackathon in Pan India.  
In the context of a hackathon, the word "hack" is used to describe how multiple technologies can be used together in a new and innovative way. Hence, AbsoluteHack provides an amazing atmosphere to put in all you've got and bring your ideas to fruition.

# Technology Used
This consists of two parts:
* FrontEnd:
    - HTML
    - Sass
    - EJS
    - Bootstrap
    - JavaScript
    - Node as build system


* Backend:
    - Django
    - PostgreSQL

# Contributing to AbsoluteHack

## General Guidelines

* Add assets such as images and other media in assets folder.
* Follow standard coding practices, naming conventions and the regular document object model (DOM).
* Make issues on GitHub to propose new features, bugs and then make a PR referencing the same.
* Make sure you update your REMOTE ORIGIN in case you have forked this repo : [Refer](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).
* Once you update the forked repo make sure you rebase the changes and then open the PR. [Refer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7244321/how-do-i-update-a-github-forked-repository).

## Submitting Issues

* Before creating a new issue, perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/GlobalTechTalks/hackathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=) in the main repo to see if a similar issue has already been submitted.
* You can create an issue [here](https://github.com/GlobalTechTalks/hackathon/issues/new). Please include as many details as possible in your report.
* Issue titles should be descriptive, explaining at the high level what it is about.
* Please include the version of the dependencies you are using, as well as what operating system you are having a problem on.
* _Do not open a [pull request](#pull-requests) to resolve an issue without first receiving feedback from a `collaborator` or `owner` and having them agree on a solution forward_.
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs whenever possible; they are immensely helpful.


## Pull Requests

* **DO NOT ISSUE A PULL REQUEST WITHOUT FIRST [SUBMITTING AN ISSUE](#submitting-issues).**
* It is now mandatory for everyone to comment on every PR made and read other people's code.
* Pull requests should reference their related issues. If the pull request closes an issue, [please reference its closing in your commit messages](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/). Pull requests not referencing any issues will be closed.
* Pull request titles should be descriptive, explaining at the high level what it is doing, and should be written in the same style as [git commit messages](#git-commit-messages).
* Every PR should only have one logical change and the least number of commits possible (if for some reasons the commits are higher then the creator of the PR would be asked to squash them.) If he/she doesn't comply, then the PR shall not be merged.     
[Refer this](https://makandracards.com/makandra/527-squash-several-git-commits-into-a-single-commit
), in case there are multiple commits.
* Do not squash or rebase your commits (with multiple logical changes) when submitting a Pull Request. It makes it much harder to follow your work and make incremental changes.
* **We accept PRs only on `develop` branch. No PRs shall be accepted on `master` branch.**

## Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense (`Add feature` not `Added Feature`).
* Use the imperative mood (`Move cursor to...` not `Moves cursor to...`).
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
