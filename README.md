# AbsoluteHacks
AbsoluteHack is a global hackathon uniting thousands of ignited minds. It is initiated by TechTalks for organizing hackathons in Pan India.
In the context of a hackathon, the word "hack" is used to describe how multiple technologies can be used together in a new and innovative way. Hence, AbsoluteHack provides an amazing atmosphere to put in all you've got and bring your ideas to fruition.

## What are we aiming for?

It is being created to ease the process of organizing and managing a hackathon. Today's tech industry requires everyone to be updated about everything but the college curriculum of institutions in India is way behind what's required in the industry. So hackathons are a way to tap the young minds of Indian students, in which they work on new challenges design prototypes and innovate something new which might become the next generation tech in the future. We aim to bring about a culture change in the academic industry where every CS student can create something valuable and big.

## Why AbsoluteHacks?

This platform is being created to ease the process of organizing and managing a hackathon. In normal scenarios, an organizer of a hackathon needs to perform several tasks such as:-

Setting up a placeholder website
Registration Pages
Mentors
RSVP system
Notifications
Sponsors 
..etc

We are trying to build a one-stop solution for the same. You just need to register your hackathon on the portal and the rest of the work is handled by the portal itself.
